    <p>All content submitted to the Site, including text, links, translations,
    images, videos, animations, songs, games, and any other materials
    (collectively referred to as "Content") is the sole responsibility of the
    person who submitted the Content. We take no responsibility for Content
    submitted to the Site by users.</p>

    <p>Any Content you submit to the Site must abide by these Terms of Service, the
    <%= link_to_wiki "Upload Rules", "help:upload_rules" %>, and the <%=
    link_to_wiki "Site Rules", "help:site_rules" %>. Although we have

    Site, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove access to Content at
    any time and for any reason, including for a violation of these Terms, a
    violation of our Upload Rules, or if you otherwise create liability for
    us.</p>

    <p>You understand that by using the Site, you may be exposed to Content
    that might be considered offensive, harmful, obscene, inaccurate,
    mislabeled, mistagged, unlawful in your jurisdiction, or otherwise
    inappropriate. The use of any Content posted on the Site or obtained by you

    <p>By submitting, posting, or uploading any Content to the Site, you
    represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority
    necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms.
    You agree you are responsible for any Content you provide to the Site,

    Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later
    developed.</p>

    <h4>Copyright Infringment</h4>

	<p>Intellectual property is not a valid form of property. Unfortunately
	there are large gangs out there pointing guns at people on behalf of
    copyright "owners". If you are one of those people begging the government
    to point their guns at people over "your" content we will comply with your
    pathetic and immoral threats using the below industry standard procedures.
    Also, you should feel ashamed.</p>

    <p>If you believe any Content on the Site infringes upon your copyright,
    you may send an email to the <%= link_to "webmaster", "mailto:#{@contact_email}" %>
    with the following pieces of information:</p>

    <ul class="list-bulleted">
      <li>A list of links to each post you believe infringes on your copyright.</li>
      <li>Your contact information.</li>
      <li>Proof of your identity.</li>
      <li>
        A statement affirming that you are the copyright holder for these
        works, under penalty of perjury.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Acceptable proof of identity includes any of the following:</p>

    <ul class="list-bulleted">
      <li>
        An email from an email address listed in one of your social media
        profiles.
      </li>

      <li>
        A copy or screenshot of the original .psd file or other source file
        of one of your works.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please be aware that information about you that does not infringe on
    your copyright will not be removed from the Site. This includes artist
    tags, artist profiles, wiki pages, comments, forum posts, links to your
    social media profiles, and links to your works on other sites.</p>

    <p>If you knowingly misrepresent that any activity or material on our Site
    is infringing, you may be liable for costs and damages.</p>

    <h4>Account Upgrades</h4>

    <p>You may submit your debit card, credit card, or other payment information
    ("Payment Information") to purchase a Gold or Platinum account upgrade or
    other products or services from the Site. We use third-party service
    providers to process your Payment Information, in accordance with our
    Privacy Policy. If you submit your Payment Information, you agree to pay
    all costs that you incur, and you give us permission to charge you when
    payment is due for an amount that includes these costs and any applicable
    taxes and fees.</p>

    <p>We may change the fees and benefits associated with Gold and Platinum
    account upgrades from time to time with reasonable advance notice;
    provided, however, that no advance notice will be required for temporary
    promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees associated with
    these account upgrades.</p>

    remain in effect. You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or
